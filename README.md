# Basic3DEngine-OpenGL
First year university project using OpenGL and GLFW to make a basic 3D scene

This project was made for my 1st year of university (level 4) for the first semester of the module known as Fundamentals of Game and Graphics System Development (FOGGS). We were tasked to create a 3D graphical scene using OpenGL and GLFW.
